===========================================
MacTheme Development Progress - Session 50
===========================================
Date: 2025-12-06
Focus: Config Validation + Light Mode Marker (Tests #142-146)
Tests Completed: 5
Status: ✅ Complete

OVERVIEW
========
Implemented validation testing for additional configuration file generators
and verified the light.mode marker file feature. All generated configs are
syntactically valid and meet the requirements for their respective tools.

COMPLETED TESTS
===============
✅ Test #142: Bat config validation (bat.conf)
✅ Test #143: Delta gitconfig validation (delta.gitconfig)
✅ Test #144: Zsh theme script validation (zsh-theme.zsh)
✅ Test #145: Raycast JSON validation (raycast.json)
✅ Test #146: Light mode marker file verification

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS
================
1. Config Validation (Tests #142-145)
   - Created test-additional-configs.js (424 lines)
   - Validated 44 configs across 11 themes (100% pass rate)
   - Bat: Validates command-line flags and theme reference
   - Delta: Validates git config syntax and color specifications
   - Zsh: Validates ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES syntax and color format
   - Raycast: Validates JSON structure and required theme fields

2. Light Mode Marker (Test #146)
   - Created test-light-mode-marker.js
   - Verified all 3 light themes have empty light.mode marker
   - Verified all 8 dark themes correctly lack the marker
   - Marker is 0 bytes (presence-based detection)

PROGRESS
========
Before: 140/202 tests passing (69.3%)
After:  145/202 tests passing (71.8%)
Improvement: +5 tests ✅
Completion: 71.8%
Remaining: 57 failing tests

TEST VERIFICATION
=================
All tests verified with comprehensive validation scripts:
- Config parsers check syntax validity
- Required fields verified for each config type
- Color format validation (hex codes, git config syntax)
- Marker file presence and size verification

FILES CREATED
=============
- test-additional-configs.js (424 lines) - Bat/Delta/Zsh/Raycast validation
- test-light-mode-marker.js (160 lines) - Light mode marker verification
- find-next-test.js - Helper to find next failing test
- show-test-details.js - Helper to show test details
