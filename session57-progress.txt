COMPLETED WORK
==============
✅ Implemented Test #193: Window titlebar shows current theme name

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
======================
Added window title functionality that displays the current theme name in the format "MacTheme - {theme-name}".

Changes Made:
1. src/main/main.ts:
   - Added updateWindowTitle(themeName: string) function to update window title
   - Set initial window title on window creation based on current theme
   - Added did-finish-load event handler to set title after page loads
   - This fixes issue where Electron was resetting the title during page load

2. src/main/ipcHandlers.ts:
   - Updated handleApplyTheme() to call updateWindowTitle() after applying theme
   - Title updates automatically when user switches themes

3. Test verification:
   - Created test-title-update.js to verify title format
   - Tested that title shows "MacTheme - tokyo-night" on launch
   - Confirmed updateWindowTitle() is called from handleApplyTheme()

TECHNICAL NOTES
===============
- Initial attempt to set title in createWindow() failed because Electron resets the title when loading the URL
- Solution: Set title again in did-finish-load event handler after page loads
- Title is now persistent and updates correctly when themes are applied

TESTING
=======
✓ Window title shows "MacTheme - tokyo-night" on launch
✓ Window title format is "MacTheme - {theme-name}"
✓ updateWindowTitle() is called when themes are applied
✓ Test script confirms correct behavior

FILES MODIFIED

NEXT STEPS

3. Optional features can be deferred as they're not core functionality
4. App is in excellent state at 96% completion
