Implement application logging system for debugging - Test #158 passing

Comprehensive logging system with timestamps, log levels, and file rotation
to support debugging and troubleshooting in production environments.

IMPLEMENTATION
==============

Core Logger Module (src/main/logger.ts):
- Created singleton Logger class with support for multiple log levels
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
- Automatic log file rotation at 5MB (keeps 3 backup files)
- Timestamps with millisecond precision (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm)
- JSON serialization for complex data structures
- Writes to: ~/Library/Application Support/mactheme/logs/mactheme.log
- Dual output: both console and file for development convenience
- Debug logging can be toggled on/off at runtime

Integration Points:
- Main process startup (src/main/main.ts)
  * Logs app initialization steps
  * Loads debug preference from preferences.json
  * Enables debug logging if configured
- IPC handlers (src/main/ipcHandlers.ts)
  * Theme application logging (info + debug)
  * Theme creation logging (info + warnings)
  * Error logging with full error details
- New IPC handlers for log management:
  * logging:getDirectory - Get log folder path
  * logging:getLogFile - Get current log file path
  * logging:clearLogs - Delete all log files
  * logging:setDebugEnabled - Toggle debug logging
  * logging:isDebugEnabled - Check debug status

UI Implementation (src/renderer/components/SettingsView.tsx):
- New Developer & Logging section in Settings
- Debug Logging toggle switch
- Open Log Folder button
- Clear Logs button with confirmation

Preload Bridge (src/preload/preload.ts):
- Exposed logging APIs to renderer process
- Type-safe IPC communication for all log operations

FEATURES
========

1. Automatic Log Rotation
   - Prevents unbounded log file growth
   - Rotates at 5MB threshold
   - Keeps 3 historical log files

2. Log Levels
   - DEBUG: Detailed debugging information (only when enabled)
   - INFO: General informational messages
   - WARN: Warning messages for non-critical issues
   - ERROR: Error messages with stack traces

3. Structured Logging
   - Consistent timestamp format
   - Log level indicators
   - JSON formatting for complex objects

TEST #158 VERIFICATION
======================

✅ Step 1: Enable debug logging in settings
✅ Step 2: Perform various actions (logged with timestamps)
✅ Step 3: Open log file location (button in Settings)
✅ Step 4: Log entries created for actions
✅ Step 5: Timestamps and log levels included

FILES MODIFIED
==============

New Files:
- src/main/logger.ts (+189 lines: complete logging system)

Modified Files:
- src/main/main.ts (+17 lines: logger integration)
- src/main/ipcHandlers.ts (+73 lines: logging calls, IPC handlers)
- src/preload/preload.ts (+6 lines: logging API exposure)
- src/renderer/components/SettingsView.tsx (+79 lines: logging UI)
- feature_list.json (marked test #158 as passing)

PROGRESS METRICS
================

Before: 196/202 tests passing (97.0%)
After:  197/202 tests passing (97.5%)
Improvement: +1 test ✅
