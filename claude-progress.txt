MacTheme Development Progress - Session 1
===========================================
Date: Initial Setup Session
Agent: Initializer Agent (Session 1 of Many)

OVERVIEW
========
This was the FIRST session in a long-running autonomous development process.
The goal was to establish the foundation for the MacTheme application and
create a comprehensive roadmap for future development sessions.

COMPLETED TASKS
===============

1. ✅ Read and Analyzed app_spec.txt
   - Thoroughly reviewed the complete specification
   - Understood the symlink-based theming architecture
   - Identified all required features and supported applications
   - Noted technical stack: Electron + React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

2. ✅ Created feature_list.json (200 Test Cases)
   - **CRITICAL FILE**: This is the single source of truth for development
   - 200+ comprehensive test cases covering:
     * 140 functional features (core functionality, IPC, file operations)
     * 60 style features (UI/UX, design system, visual polish)
   - Each feature has detailed step-by-step testing instructions
   - Features ordered by priority (fundamental features first)
   - Includes both narrow tests (2-5 steps) and comprehensive tests (10+ steps)
   - 25+ tests with 10+ steps each for complex features
   - All tests start with "passes": false

   **IMPORTANT**: Features should ONLY be marked as passing, never removed or edited.
   This ensures no functionality is missed during implementation.

3. ✅ Created init.sh Setup Script
   - Automated development environment setup
   - Checks for Node.js and npm
   - Installs dependencies if needed
   - Creates necessary directory structure
   - Provides clear instructions for starting development
   - Made executable with chmod +x

4. ✅ Created Comprehensive README.md

   - Installation instructions
   - Development workflow guide
   - Architecture documentation
   - Technology stack details
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Roadmap and phases

CURRENT STATE
=============

The project is now in a clean, initialized state with:
- ✅ Complete project scaffolding
- ✅ All configuration files in place
- ✅ Basic Electron + React structure
- ✅ Comprehensive test case roadmap
- ✅ Development workflow documented
- ✅ Git repository initialized

The application structure includes:
- Native macOS window with hidden inset title bar

- TypeScript types for all data structures
- IPC channels defined in preload script
- macOS design system in CSS (SF Pro fonts, vibrancy, 8px grid)

WHAT'S NEXT FOR FUTURE AGENTS
==============================

The next agent should:

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Run: ./init.sh or npm install

2. **Review feature_list.json**
   - Start with the highest priority features (listed first)
   - Focus on fundamental features before advanced ones

3. **Recommended Implementation Order**

   Phase 1 - Core Theme System (Features 1-20 in feature_list.json):
   - Directory structure creation on first launch
   - Theme loading and parsing
   - Symlink management utilities
   - Basic theme metadata handling
   - Bundle initial themes (Tokyo Night, Catppuccin, etc.)

   Phase 2 - Theme Browser UI (Features 21-40):
   - Theme grid component
   - Theme cards with color previews
   - Search and filtering
   - Theme detail modal
   - Apply theme functionality

   Phase 3 - Theme Application (Features 41-70):
   - Symlink updating
   - State persistence
   - Wallpaper setting via osascript
   - Notification system
   - IPC handler implementation

   Phase 4 - Application Integration (Features 71-90):
   - App detection logic
   - Setup wizard
   - Config file modification
   - App refresh mechanisms

   And so on through all 200+ features...

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Work on ONE feature at a time
   - Implement the feature completely
   - Test thoroughly using the steps in feature_list.json
   - Mark feature as "passes": true only when ALL steps pass
   - Commit your work with descriptive message
   - Move to next feature

5. **Before Session Ends**
   - Commit all work with clear messages
   - Update this claude-progress.txt file
   - Mark completed features in feature_list.json
   - Leave environment in clean, working state

CRITICAL REMINDERS
==================

❗ NEVER remove or edit features in feature_list.json
   - Only change "passes": false to "passes": true
   - This ensures complete coverage

❗ Focus on QUALITY over speed
   - Production-ready is the goal
   - Test exhaustively before marking features as passing

❗ Commit frequently
   - Save progress for future sessions
   - Use descriptive commit messages

❗ Read this file at start of each session
   - Understand what was done before
   - Continue from where previous agent left off

TECHNOLOGY STACK
=================

Frontend:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for bundling and dev server
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons

Backend:
- Electron (main process)
- Node.js with TypeScript
- JSON files for storage

Key Electron Features to Implement:
- IPC communication (context bridge)
- Native macOS UI (vibrancy, title bar)
- File system operations (symlinks)
- System appearance detection
- Global keyboard shortcuts
- Menu bar integration
- Notifications

RESOURCES
=========

- app_spec.txt - Complete specification (READ THIS FIRST)
- feature_list.json - Development roadmap (200+ test cases)
- README.md - Project documentation
- init.sh - Quick setup script

FILE LOCATIONS
==============

Application directories (will be created on first run):
- ~/Library/Application Support/MacTheme/themes/
- ~/Library/Application Support/MacTheme/custom-themes/
- ~/Library/Application Support/MacTheme/current/
- ~/Library/Application Support/MacTheme/preferences.json
- ~/Library/Application Support/MacTheme/state.json

NOTES FOR NEXT AGENT
=====================

The foundation is solid and ready for implementation. The most important
next steps are:

1. Get the development environment running (npm install && npm run dev)
2. Implement the theme directory creation and bundled theme installation
3. Build the theme loading and parsing system
4. Implement symlink management
5. Create the theme grid UI

Each of these has detailed test cases in feature_list.json. Follow them
carefully and mark features as passing only when fully tested.

Good luck, and happy coding! 🎨

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
=================================

**Component Architecture**:
- ThemeEditor is a standalone, reusable component
- Accepts optional initialTheme prop for editing existing themes
- Self-contained state management
- Callbacks for save and cancel actions
- No external dependencies beyond types and API

**Data Flow**:
1. User clicks theme card → modal opens
2. User clicks Edit in modal → modal closes, onEdit fired
3. App.tsx receives theme object, sets editorTheme state
4. App.tsx navigates to editor view
5. ThemeEditor renders with initialTheme prop
6. User edits colors and metadata
7. User clicks Save → createTheme IPC called
8. Main process generates theme files
9. Notification shown, onSave callback fires
10. App returns to themes view, theme appears in grid

**Color Picker Implementation**:
- Native HTML5 `<input type="color">` for visual picking
- Separate text input for hex code entry
- Both inputs bound to same state value
- Changes to either input update the other
- Instant preview updates via React state

**Live Preview Updates**:
- All preview elements use inline styles
- Styles reference theme.colors state
- Any color change triggers re-render
- Terminal, code, and palette all update instantly
- Demonstrates how theme will look in practice

**File Generation**:
- Uses existing generator functions from themeInstaller
- Consistent with bundled theme generation
- All 13 config files created atomically
- Proper error handling if creation fails

**Theme Directory Structure**:
```
~/Library/Application Support/MacTheme/

│   └── my-custom-theme/

CRITICAL NOTES
==============

✅ All code compiles successfully
✅ No runtime errors in console
✅ App launches and displays all views
✅ Theme editor renders correctly with all sections
✅ Color pickers functional with native HTML5 inputs
✅ Live preview updates in real-time
✅ IPC communication working perfectly
✅ Theme generation creates all 13 config files
✅ Symlink creation logic verified
✅ Themes load from disk successfully (11 bundled themes)

The theme editor is now fully functional and provides an excellent user
experience for creating custom themes. The live preview makes it easy to
see how colors will look before saving. The integration with the modal's
Edit button provides a smooth workflow from browsing to editing.

Next priorities should focus on:
1. Wallpaper support (complete the theming experience)
2. Application integration (make themes usable in terminals/editors)
3. Theme import/export (share themes with others)

Progress Summary: 30/202 tests passing (15% complete)
