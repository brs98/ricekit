MacTheme Development Progress - Session 1
===========================================
Date: Initial Setup Session
Agent: Initializer Agent (Session 1 of Many)

OVERVIEW
========
This was the FIRST session in a long-running autonomous development process.
The goal was to establish the foundation for the MacTheme application and
create a comprehensive roadmap for future development sessions.

COMPLETED TASKS
===============

1. ✅ Read and Analyzed app_spec.txt
   - Thoroughly reviewed the complete specification
   - Understood the symlink-based theming architecture
   - Identified all required features and supported applications
   - Noted technical stack: Electron + React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

2. ✅ Created feature_list.json (200 Test Cases)
   - **CRITICAL FILE**: This is the single source of truth for development
   - 200+ comprehensive test cases covering:
     * 140 functional features (core functionality, IPC, file operations)
     * 60 style features (UI/UX, design system, visual polish)
   - Each feature has detailed step-by-step testing instructions
   - Features ordered by priority (fundamental features first)
   - Includes both narrow tests (2-5 steps) and comprehensive tests (10+ steps)
   - 25+ tests with 10+ steps each for complex features
   - All tests start with "passes": false

   **IMPORTANT**: Features should ONLY be marked as passing, never removed or edited.
   This ensures no functionality is missed during implementation.

3. ✅ Created init.sh Setup Script
   - Automated development environment setup
   - Checks for Node.js and npm
   - Installs dependencies if needed
   - Creates necessary directory structure
   - Provides clear instructions for starting development
   - Made executable with chmod +x

4. ✅ Created Comprehensive README.md
   - Project overview and features
   - Installation instructions
   - Development workflow guide
   - Architecture documentation
   - Technology stack details
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Roadmap and phases

5. ✅ Initialized Project Structure
   Created complete Electron + React + Vite project with:

   Configuration Files:
   - package.json - Dependencies and scripts
   - tsconfig.json - TypeScript configuration for renderer
   - tsconfig.main.json - TypeScript configuration for main process
   - tsconfig.node.json - TypeScript configuration for Node tooling
   - vite.config.ts - Vite bundler configuration
   - tailwind.config.js - Tailwind CSS styling
   - postcss.config.js - PostCSS configuration
   - .eslintrc.json - ESLint linting rules
   - .prettierrc - Code formatting rules
   - .gitignore - Git ignore patterns
   - index.html - Application entry HTML

   Source Code:
   - src/main/main.ts - Electron main process (window creation, native features)
   - src/preload/preload.ts - Context bridge for secure IPC
   - src/renderer/App.tsx - Main React component with navigation
   - src/renderer/App.css - Application styles with macOS design system
   - src/renderer/main.tsx - React entry point
   - src/shared/types.ts - TypeScript interfaces and types for the entire app

   Directory Structure:
   - src/main/ - Electron main process code
   - src/renderer/ - React UI code
   - src/preload/ - Preload scripts
   - src/shared/ - Shared types and utilities
   - public/ - Static assets

6. ✅ Initialized Git Repository
   - Created git repository
   - Made initial commit with all foundation files
   - Commit includes descriptive message explaining the setup

CURRENT STATE
=============

The project is now in a clean, initialized state with:
- ✅ Complete project scaffolding
- ✅ All configuration files in place
- ✅ Basic Electron + React structure
- ✅ Comprehensive test case roadmap
- ✅ Development workflow documented
- ✅ Git repository initialized

The application structure includes:
- Native macOS window with hidden inset title bar
- Sidebar navigation (Themes, Editor, Apps, Wallpapers, Settings)
- Main content area with view switching
- TypeScript types for all data structures
- IPC channels defined in preload script
- macOS design system in CSS (SF Pro fonts, vibrancy, 8px grid)

WHAT'S NEXT FOR FUTURE AGENTS
==============================

The next agent should:

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Run: ./init.sh or npm install

2. **Review feature_list.json**
   - Start with the highest priority features (listed first)
   - Focus on fundamental features before advanced ones

3. **Recommended Implementation Order**

   Phase 1 - Core Theme System (Features 1-20 in feature_list.json):
   - Directory structure creation on first launch
   - Theme loading and parsing
   - Symlink management utilities
   - Basic theme metadata handling
   - Bundle initial themes (Tokyo Night, Catppuccin, etc.)

   Phase 2 - Theme Browser UI (Features 21-40):
   - Theme grid component
   - Theme cards with color previews
   - Search and filtering
   - Theme detail modal
   - Apply theme functionality

   Phase 3 - Theme Application (Features 41-70):
   - Symlink updating
   - State persistence
   - Wallpaper setting via osascript
   - Notification system
   - IPC handler implementation

   Phase 4 - Application Integration (Features 71-90):
   - App detection logic
   - Setup wizard
   - Config file modification
   - App refresh mechanisms

   And so on through all 200+ features...

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Work on ONE feature at a time
   - Implement the feature completely
   - Test thoroughly using the steps in feature_list.json
   - Mark feature as "passes": true only when ALL steps pass
   - Commit your work with descriptive message
   - Move to next feature

5. **Before Session Ends**
   - Commit all work with clear messages
   - Update this claude-progress.txt file
   - Mark completed features in feature_list.json
   - Leave environment in clean, working state

CRITICAL REMINDERS
==================

❗ NEVER remove or edit features in feature_list.json
   - Only change "passes": false to "passes": true
   - This ensures complete coverage

❗ Focus on QUALITY over speed
   - Production-ready is the goal
   - Test exhaustively before marking features as passing

❗ Commit frequently
   - Save progress for future sessions
   - Use descriptive commit messages

❗ Read this file at start of each session
   - Understand what was done before
   - Continue from where previous agent left off

TECHNOLOGY STACK
=================

Frontend:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for bundling and dev server
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons

Backend:
- Electron (main process)
- Node.js with TypeScript
- JSON files for storage

Key Electron Features to Implement:
- IPC communication (context bridge)
- Native macOS UI (vibrancy, title bar)
- File system operations (symlinks)
- System appearance detection
- Global keyboard shortcuts
- Menu bar integration
- Notifications

RESOURCES
=========

- app_spec.txt - Complete specification (READ THIS FIRST)
- feature_list.json - Development roadmap (200+ test cases)
- README.md - Project documentation
- init.sh - Quick setup script

FILE LOCATIONS
==============

Application directories (will be created on first run):
- ~/Library/Application Support/MacTheme/themes/
- ~/Library/Application Support/MacTheme/custom-themes/
- ~/Library/Application Support/MacTheme/current/
- ~/Library/Application Support/MacTheme/preferences.json
- ~/Library/Application Support/MacTheme/state.json

NOTES FOR NEXT AGENT
=====================

The foundation is solid and ready for implementation. The most important
next steps are:

1. Get the development environment running (npm install && npm run dev)
2. Implement the theme directory creation and bundled theme installation
3. Build the theme loading and parsing system
4. Implement symlink management
5. Create the theme grid UI

Each of these has detailed test cases in feature_list.json. Follow them
carefully and mark features as passing only when fully tested.

Good luck, and happy coding! 🎨
